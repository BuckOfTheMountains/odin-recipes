    <p>George's Wings of Pastrami</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>Do you feel like your old self? Toally inadequate, completly insecure,
    paranoid, neurotic? Do you have it all, are you disturbed, depressed? Well, you can go stuff your sorries in a sack,
    next to your wallet, as it hold all the other important things, and walk up to that beautiful person in the copy shop
    and say, <em>hi, I am yadda-yadda, I am unemployed and live with my parents</em>, next thing you know, you 
    just may be fortunate enough to spend an evening with a woman enjoying the natural pleasures in life; food and sex.
    Tempted to combine them? I was, it just doesn't match well with a side of TV or removing used dental floss from your pocket. 
    I had it all, now it's back to serenity now...</p>

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>14oz of Katz's Deli Pastrami</li>
            <li>Two thick slices of seeded marble rye</li>
            <li>4 slices of swiss cheese</li>

            <li>1 small red and green cabbage</li>
            <li>1 small endive and radiccico</li>
            <li>1.5 cups Shredded carrorts<li>
            <li>1.5 cups of shredded celery</li>
            <li>6 Thinly shredded green onions</li>
            <li>1 small red bell pepper diced</li>
            <li>1 large jalapeno diced</li>
            <li>1 habanero diced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of lime juice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup ranch dressing</li>
            <li>Celery salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Lemon pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Parsley and cilantro, to taste</li>
            <li>Garlic powder, dash, optional</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <li>1. Heat a griddle, butter the seeded marble rye, Schnitzer's brand is prefered especially if 
        taken off of a fishing hook 4 stories in the air. Get it toasted but not burnt.
        <li>2. Add hot German mustard on one side, layer on two slices of cheese, then the Kat's pastrami,
            followed by the additional slices of cheese.
            <li>3. In a large mixing bowl, one that would comfortably fit a big salad, assemble the slaw in the 
                following order; thinly slice the green and red cabbages, the endive and radiccico, green onions and 
                incorporate. Mix in the carrots and celery, followed by the thinly diced red bell pepper, large jalapeno
                and habanero. Incorporate the ranch dressing and lime juice. Season with celery salt and lemon pepper
                to taste, follwed by the parsley and cilantro if using, a dash of garlic powder never hurts. Add slaw
                to the bottom part of the sandwhich and assemble. Or have on the side.
                <li>4. Hide sandwhich in a bedroom end table just before making love. Procede to make love and 
                    snack intermittently. Pairs well with cold Pepsi. If all fails, head to the diner for a plate of 
                    chicken salad on rye, untoasted, with a cup of tea.
