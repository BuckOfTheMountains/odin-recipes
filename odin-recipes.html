    <p>A Festivus Feast!</p>

    <p>Many nights ago, I went through a drive through for dinner. As Joe Pesci said in Lethal Weapon,
        -They fuck you at the drive through!- After opening my bag of cold soggy curly fries, I realized there had to be a better way to satisfy my hunger.
        Thus, I have prepared these recipes to help out those in similiar situations. And for those who can't cook, well
        you couldn't smooth a silk sheet with a hot date... and I forget my train of thought. Just, indulge!
