    <p>Cream of Mushroom Soup alla Yev Kassem</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>Do you ever yearn, yearn for good soup? We're not talking
        craving, <em>yearning!</em>Mushrooms are underrated. Fabulous, flavor-bomb fungi like cremini 
        or button mushrooms are widely available all year long, relatively inexpensive, and incredibly versatile
         in the kitchen. Almost every time we are at the store, we make sure to pick up a good bag full 
         of buttons or creminis. And if wild mushrooms like chanterelles or morels are in season, 
         we will often treat ourselves to those, too. Why? 
         Because you can easily build an entire meal around their earthy, savory, meaty goodness. 
         You can make a simple risotto, or a creamy sauce for pasta, or if you really want the mushroomy flavor to shine, 
        you can make a hearty, silky potful of cream of mushroom soup. Perfect for nights when tossing up
        a marble rye 4 stories or before storming into the waves as a marine biologist. </p>
