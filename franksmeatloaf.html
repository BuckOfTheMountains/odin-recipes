    <p>Frank's Festivus Meatloaf</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>Welcome newcomers, and those of old! While traditionally the holiday of
    Festivus begins with the airing of grivences, first, after we've assembled the tinsel free pole from the 
basement, we do have the holiday feast. While some skeptics claimed we do pasta, that's only a side dish.
The primairy meal is a wonderful meatloaf. The meatloaf is so tender and juicy on the inside with a 
sweet and tangy sauce that glazes the meatloaf and adds so much flavor! Dig in while informing all of your 
family members in just all of the ways that they have <em>disapointed</em> you this year.</p>

<h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
<p>
<ul>
<h3>Meatloaf</h3>
    <li>2 pounds of ground beef</li>
    <li>1 large onion finely chopped</li>

    <li>1/2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoons of paprikia</li>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>

    <li>1/2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
    <li>1/3 teaspoons of salt</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a 9”x5” loaf pan with parchment paper and preheat oven to 375°F.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add all of the ingredients for the meatloaf. Mix well to combine.</li>
        <li>Add meat to the loaf pan, gently press meat down and shape evenly 
            and bake meatloaf at 375˚F for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix all of the ingredients together for the sauce. 
            Spread the sauce over meatloaf then return to oven and bake additional 
            15-20 minutes or until the internal temperature is 160˚F. Rest meatloaf 10 minutes before slicing.
             Drizzle with baking juices from the pan. </li>
             <li>You may now commence with the airing of grivences! Serve meatloaf over a bed of lettuce,
                pair with a side of pasta noodles, and jello without the bananas. Once the meat is completed,
                it is time to move onto the feats of strength. Pin the host, but beware, he has gas. Happy Festivus!</li>
